- 👋 Hi, I’m Mahmoud Elnakhlawy
- 👀 I’m passionate about programming and business, and I enjoy finding innovative ways to connect the two. In addition to coding and entrepreneurship, I’m deeply interested in martial arts 🥋, reading 📚, continuous learning 🤓, spending quality time with family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, and savoring coffee ☕️ and tea 🍵 to fuel my day.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving into the MERN stack, with the goal of mastering full-stack development and creating amazing web apps! 🚀
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a wide range of projects—whether personal, team-based, or open-source—to deepen my programming skills and gain real-world experience. I enjoy working with technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. My goal is to keep learning, build an impressive portfolio with meaningful projects, and grow both technically and creatively along the way. I’m excited to connect with like-minded people and create something awesome together!
